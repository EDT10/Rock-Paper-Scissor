computer will randomly select a option between rock, scissors, and paper. I will place the options in a list

Ask the user to choose between rock, scissors, and paper. Also in a list

Take string input from user and compare it against the computer's choice. This is will be done using comparison operators

Determine who has won: 

If user and computer chose the same option, it is a tie. 

If one chose rock, and one chose scissors, rock has won. 

If one chose scissors, and one chose paper, scissors has won. 

If one chose paper, and one chose rock, paper has won.

Announce the winner if there was one, or a tie if not. 

Use a while loop and ask the user if they want to try again. 

Exit loop if they say no, and start from the beginning if they say yes.
